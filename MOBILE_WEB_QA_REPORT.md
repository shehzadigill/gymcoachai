## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Desktop Sidebar Visible on Mobile (SEVERITY: HIGH)

**Status:** ‚ùå FAILED  
**Page(s) Affected:** All pages (Dashboard, Workouts sections, etc.)  
**Screenshot:** `mobile-dashboard-loading.png`, `mobile-workouts-submenu.png`

**Description:**
The desktop sidebar is rendering on mobile viewport (390px width), consuming approximately 235px of screen real estate. This severely impacts UX by:

- Reducing available content area
- Forcing content to be cramped
- Making the app look broken on mobile devices
- Violating mobile-first design principles

**Expected Behavior:**

- Desktop sidebar should be completely hidden on screens < 1024px
- Mobile hamburger menu should be the only navigation option
- Sidebar class `hidden lg:flex` should work correctly

**Actual Behavior:**

- Desktop sidebar is visible and taking up ~60% of screen width
- Hamburger menu icon is present but desktop nav also shows
- Content is pushed to narrow right side

**Location:** `/apps/web/src/app/[locale]/client-layout.tsx:199-215`

**Code Analysis:**

```tsx
{/* Desktop sidebar */}
<div
  className={`hidden lg:flex lg:flex-shrink-0 transition-all duration-300 ${desktopSidebarCollapsed ? 'lg:w-16' : 'lg:w-64'}`}
>
  <SidebarContent ... />
</div>
```

**Potential Causes:**

1. Tailwind CSS not processing responsive classes correctly
2. CSS override in `globals.css`
3. Build/compilation issue
4. Viewport meta tag misconfiguration

**Fix Priority:** üî• IMMEDIATE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

### 2. Workouts Submenu on Mobile

**Status:** ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING  
**Screenshot:** `mobile-workouts-submenu.png`

**Description:**
When Workouts menu is expanded on mobile, submenu items are visible. Need to verify:

- Are submenu items readable?
- Is touch target size adequate (minimum 44x44px)?
- Does submenu overlay content properly?
- Can users easily collapse the menu?

**Action Required:** Further testing after sidebar fix

- ‚è≥ Exercise Library
- ‚è≥ Workout Analytics
- ‚è≥ Workout History

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix 1: Sidebar Responsive Behavior

**File:** `/apps/web/src/app/[locale]/client-layout.tsx`

**Strategy:**

1. Verify Tailwind config includes all responsive breakpoints
2. Check for CSS overrides in `globals.css`
3. Add explicit mobile styles if needed:
   ```tsx
   className={`hidden lg:flex lg:flex-shrink-0 ...`}
   // Should render as display: none on mobile
   ```
4. Test with different mobile viewports (360px, 375px, 390px, 414px)

**Validation:**

- Desktop sidebar completely invisible on mobile
- Only hamburger menu visible
- Content uses full width (minus padding)
- No horizontal scroll

---

### Fix 2: Mobile Menu Accessibility

**After fixing sidebar:**

1. Ensure hamburger menu is easily tappable (48x48px minimum)
2. Verify menu animation is smooth
3. Test menu open/close behavior
4. Check backdrop/overlay functionality

---

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Fix sidebar visibility issue
2. Retest all pages on mobile viewport
3. Document additional issues found
4. Fix translation implementation for workout pages
5. Comprehensive cross-browser testing (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)
6. Performance testing on actual mobile devices
7. Accessibility audit with screen readers
