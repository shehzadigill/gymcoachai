# Phase 3 Validation Tests - Rust Testing Framework

This directory contains comprehensive Rust-based tests for the Phase 3 Backend Lambda Services implementation. The tests are designed to validate all aspects of the backend services, including functionality, performance, security, and integration.

## Test Structure

### Test Suites

1. **Unit Tests** (`src/unit_tests.rs`)
   - Individual service functionality testing
   - CRUD operations validation
   - Input validation testing
   - Business logic testing

2. **Integration Tests** (`src/integration_tests.rs`)
   - Cross-service integration testing
   - Data consistency validation
   - Error handling across services
   - Performance testing

3. **End-to-End Tests** (`src/e2e_tests.rs`)
   - Complete user journey testing
   - Workflow validation
   - Error recovery testing
   - Load testing

4. **Validation Tests** (`src/validation_tests.rs`)
   - Phase 3 specific validation
   - Database consistency testing
   - File upload/download testing
   - Security penetration testing
   - API documentation accuracy

### Test Utilities

- **Test Utils** (`src/lib.rs`)
  - Mock data generation
  - Event creation utilities
  - Response validation helpers
  - Performance measurement tools

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ installed
- AWS credentials configured (for integration tests)
- DynamoDB and S3 access (for integration tests)

### Running All Tests

```bash
# From the project root
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Or from the tests directory
cd tests/rust-tests
cargo test --release
```

### Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests only
cargo test --release unit_tests

# Integration tests only
cargo test --release integration_tests

# End-to-end tests only
cargo test --release e2e_tests

# Validation tests only
cargo test --release validation_tests
```

### Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test
cargo test --release test_user_profile_crud_operations

# Run tests with output
cargo test --release -- --nocapture

# Run tests in parallel
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=4
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables

The tests use the following environment variables:

- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for DynamoDB and S3
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE`: DynamoDB table name
- `S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name for file uploads
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT secret for authentication
- `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`: Cognito User Pool ID
- `COGNITO_REGION`: Cognito region

### Test Data

Test data is generated using the `test_utils` module, which provides:

- Mock user profiles
- Mock workout plans
- Mock workout sessions
- Mock exercises
- Mock progress photos
- Mock analytics data
- Mock AI recommendations

- Security across services
- Monitoring and logging
- Scalability testing

### 3. End-to-End Tests

Test complete user workflows:

- Complete user journey
- Workout planning workflow
- Progress tracking workflow
- AI coaching workflow
- Analytics reporting workflow
- Error recovery workflow
- Performance under load
- Security penetration
- Monitoring and alerting
- Scalability testing

### 4. Validation Tests

Test Phase 3 specific requirements:

- CRUD operations validation
- Database consistency testing
- File upload/download testing
- Error conditions testing
- Performance under load
- Security penetration testing
- Monitoring and logging validation
- Cross-service integration
- API documentation accuracy

## Test Results

### Success Criteria

All tests must pass for Phase 3 to be considered complete:

- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ All end-to-end tests pass
- ✅ All validation tests pass
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Security tests pass
- ✅ Monitoring tests pass

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Throughput**: > 1000 requests/second
- **Concurrent Users**: > 1000 concurrent users
- **Memory Usage**: < 256MB per Lambda function
- **Cold Start**: < 1 second

### Security Requirements

- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ SQL injection protection
- ✅ NoSQL injection protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Authentication/authorization
- ✅ Data encryption
- ✅ Secure file uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Credentials Not Found**

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

2. **DynamoDB Table Not Found**
   - Ensure the table exists in the specified region
   - Check table permissions
   - Verify table name in environment variables

3. **S3 Bucket Not Found**
   - Ensure the bucket exists in the specified region
   - Check bucket permissions
   - Verify bucket name in environment variables

4. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase test timeout in Cargo.toml
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify AWS service availability

### Debug Mode

Run tests with debug output:

```bash
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

### Verbose Output

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
cargo test --release -- --verbose
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Include proper error messages
4. Add appropriate assertions
5. Update this README if needed

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:

- All service endpoints
- All CRUD operations
- All validation rules
- All error conditions
