# ✅ Metro Dependency Resolution Error FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem Solved!

The Metro bundler dependency resolution errors have been successfully resolved!

## 🔧 What We Fixed:

### 1. **Metro Cache Issues**

- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- **Cause**: Metro bundler had corrupted cache from the Firebase package changes
- **Solution**: Completely cleared Metro caches and restarted with clean state

### 2. **Cache Clearing Process**

- ❌ Killed all Metro processes on port 8081
- ❌ Removed Metro cache files
- ❌ Cleared Watchman cache (optional)
- ✅ Restarted Metro with `--reset-cache` flag

### 3. **Resolution Steps Applied**

```bash
# Kill Metro processes
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Clear caches
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
rm -rf /tmp/haste-map-*

# Start fresh
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```
